## About us
Team Sibyl is an ad-hoc research group operating under the Cloud Computing and Big Data center in PES University.

Our focus is on fuzzing techniques, specifically with ways to extend them to massive distributed applications running in the cloud.

## Contributing
If you are a member of the team, you should:
1. Apply to this GitHub organization, if you are not already a member.
2. Install the [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) extension(Firefox and Chrome both have one).

If you are one of our supervisors/faculty, you can see our current status, as well as our general progress on the Zenhub board linked to this repository.

If you are neither of those, you probably shouldn't be here, though if you have an idea, an issue/PR is always welcome.

## Isuue tracking
All of our progress is tracked through the Github issue tracker.
We use Zenhub boards to help in keeping track of our issues and our progress.

See the guide [here](ISSUES.md).
