# Progress Tracking
This page discusses the process for tracking our progress through issues.

## Rationale
Having a physical log of everything that we do can help us in quite a few ways:
1. It makes it easy to communicate our current progress, roadblocks, and successes to _anyone_. This also makes it much easier make good reports for our faculty advisers.
2. It makes our progress visible, and thus it keeps us accountable for our progress(or lack thereof).
3. It minimizes the need for communication between team members.
4. It allows us to easily set deadlines for each target.

## Boards
This repo has a Zenhub board attached to it, showing a general overview of our process.
It will show what we are currently considering, what we are going to do next, things that are blocked because of other things, and so on.
If you don't have Zenhub installed already, go grab the extension before you do anything else.
We will likely never require another board, but if we do add one, they will be synced to this one, to ensure that this board contains a total overview of everything we are doing.

## Procedure and Policy
If you are done with all the issues assigned to you and are looking for something to do, take a look at the *New Issues*, *Backlog*, or *In Progress* pipelines in the board.
If there is no issue assigned to you, go ahead and pick out an unassigned issue and assign it to yourself.

Feel free to add new issues wherever necessary.
However, decisions to form new epics, or convert individual issues to epics, should be made after a discussion with the rest of the team.

## Other repositories
We are going to need to create new repositories pretty soon, to hold our actual research, code, and so on.
If you are creating a new repository, you have two choices:
1. Directly create it under the TeamSybil github account.
2. Create it under your account, and then transfer ownership to TeamSybil(possibly after working on it).

This repository should act as a directory for all the other repositories, so when you create the repo, you should add a bit of documentation either in its own `.md` file, or in `repos.md`.
